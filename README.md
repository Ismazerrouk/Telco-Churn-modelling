## Introduction
Customer churn is a critical issue for telecommunications companies. This project focuses on identifying the factors that influence customer churn and building predictive models to classify customers as churned or not churned.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains information about customer demographics, account information, and services subscribed. The dataset includes the following columns:
- `customerID`: Customer ID
- `gender`: Whether the customer is a male or a female
- `SeniorCitizen`: Whether the customer is a senior citizen or not (1, 0)
- `Partner`: Whether the customer has a partner or not (Yes, No)
- `Dependents`: Whether the customer has dependents or not (Yes, No)
- `tenure`: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company
- `PhoneService`: Whether the customer has phone service or not (Yes, No)
- `MultipleLines`: Whether the customer has multiple lines or not (Yes, No, No phone service)
- `InternetService`: Customer’s internet service provider (DSL, Fiber optic, No)
- `OnlineSecurity`: Whether the customer has online security or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
- `OnlineBackup`: Whether the customer has online backup or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
- `DeviceProtection`: Whether the customer has device protection or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
- `TechSupport`: Whether the customer has tech support or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
- `StreamingTV`: Whether the customer has streaming TV or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
- `StreamingMovies`: Whether the customer has streaming movies or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
- `Contract`: The contract term of the customer (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)
- `PaperlessBilling`: Whether the customer has paperless billing or not (Yes, No)
- `PaymentMethod`: The customer’s payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer (automatic), Credit card (automatic))
- `MonthlyCharges`: The amount charged to the customer monthly
- `TotalCharges`: The total amount charged to the customer
- `Churn`: Whether the customer churned or not (Yes, No)

## Features 

-Data preprocessing and exploration 🔍
-Feature engineering 🛠️
-Model training and evaluation 🏋️‍♂️
-Feature importance analysis 📈
-Data visualization 🎨

## Results
The analysis reveals that customers with shorter tenure and month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn. The Random Forest model performed the best in predicting customer churn with an accuracy of 85.36%. The most important feature influencing churn is MonthlyCharges

## Feature Importance
The top 10 most important features identified by the Random Forest model are:

1.MonthlyCharges
2.TotalCharges
3.tenure
4.Contract
5.InternetService
6.OnlineSecurity
7.TechSupport
8.PaymentMethod
9.StreamingTV
10.StreamingMovies
